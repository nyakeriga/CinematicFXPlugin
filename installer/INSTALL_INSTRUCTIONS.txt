CinematicFX Plugin - Installation Instructions
================================================================================

⚠️ IMPORTANT: This plugin currently works in AFTER EFFECTS only!
   Premiere Pro requires additional PiPL resource (see below)

FILES INCLUDED:
  - CinematicFX.prm           (The plugin)
  - vcruntime140.dll          (Required Visual C++ Runtime)
  - Install_AfterEffects.bat  (Automated installer for After Effects)
  - Install_Premiere.bat      (Automated installer for Premiere - WON'T WORK)

================================================================================
QUICK INSTALL - AFTER EFFECTS (RECOMMENDED):
================================================================================

1. Right-click "Install_AfterEffects.bat" → Run as Administrator

2. The installer will automatically:
   - Find your After Effects installation
   - Copy both required files
   - Show success confirmation

3. Restart After Effects

4. Find the effect at: Effect → CinematicFX → CinematicFX


================================================================================
MANUAL INSTALLATION - AFTER EFFECTS:
================================================================================

1. Close Adobe After Effects if it's running

2. Copy BOTH files to:
   C:\Program Files\Adobe\Adobe After Effects [VERSION]\Support Files\Plug-ins\
   
   Files to copy:
   - CinematicFX.prm
   - vcruntime140.dll
   
   Replace [VERSION] with your AE version (e.g., 2024, 2025)

3. Restart After Effects

4. Find the effect at: Effect → CinematicFX → CinematicFX


================================================================================
WHY PREMIERE PRO DOESN'T WORK:
================================================================================

Premiere Pro logs show: "No loaders recognized this plugin"

ROOT CAUSE:
  The plugin is missing an embedded PiPL (Plugin Property List) resource
  that Premiere Pro requires to recognize .prm plugins.

TECHNICAL EXPLANATION:
  - After Effects can load plugins based on exported entry points alone
  - Premiere Pro requires a binary PiPL resource embedded in the .prm file
  - Windows .rc resource files don't support Mac PiPL syntax
  - Need Adobe's PiPLTool.exe compiler (from SDK) to create proper resource

TO FIX FOR PREMIERE PRO (Advanced):
  1. Obtain PiPLTool.exe from Adobe SDK
  2. Compile resources/PiPL.r to Windows binary format
  3. Embed compiled resource in CMakeLists.txt
  4. Rebuild plugin
  5. Test in Premiere Pro

CURRENT STATUS:
  ✅ Fully functional in Adobe After Effects
  ❌ Not recognized by Adobe Premiere Pro (needs PiPL resource work)


================================================================================
ALTERNATIVE: Install Visual C++ Redistributable (Recommended)
================================================================================

Instead of copying vcruntime140.dll, you can install the official runtime:

1. Download from Microsoft:
   https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vc_redist.x64.exe

2. Run the installer

3. Then you only need to copy CinematicFX.prm (not the .dll)


================================================================================
TROUBLESHOOTING:
================================================================================

PLUGIN DOESN'T APPEAR:
  ✓ Verify BOTH files are copied to the plugins folder
  ✓ Restart Adobe software completely
  ✓ Check Windows Security hasn't blocked the files
  ✓ Right-click each file → Properties → Unblock (if present)

PLUGIN CRASHES ON LOAD:
  ✓ Install Visual C++ Redistributable (link above)
  ✓ Update your graphics drivers
  ✓ Try CPU-only mode (CUDA not required)

SLOW PERFORMANCE:
  ✓ Current version uses CPU rendering
  ✓ For GPU acceleration: Install CUDA 12.4+ and rebuild
  ✓ Lower resolution for preview, full quality for export


================================================================================
